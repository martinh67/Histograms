# Histograms

My second assignment for week 3 for Fundamentals of Programming completed **29/11/2020**:

One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts (sometimes called 'histograms'). Write a program that first reads and stores five numbers (each between 1 and 30). Then, for each number read, your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks (e.g. for the number seven, it should print *******), so that it displays five rows of asterisks.
